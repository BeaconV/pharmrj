## Who Am I

I am a an Experienced Pharmacist who has been working in the Health Service for over 20 years. I enjoy tinkering around with technology. Whether that is websites like this or new things like AI. I am also on Twitter (I still refuse to call it X) and have various rants and rambles about most things.

I am also passionate about "free and open source" software, the repurposing and reuse of "obsolete" technology and generally thinking of how I can minimise my impact on the planet.

Another thing I enjoy is reading and trying to understand more about the evidence around medicine and making the best use of them, but ensuring we are involving patients in decisions about their medicines and goals in life.

## What about Non Nerd Pharmacy Stuff?

I enjoy building Lego with my 2 young kids, and the usual stuff: reading books📚, watching movies🎬, trying to exercise when I can🏃

## What is this site for?

It will be a random collection and musings of the above. I am no expert web developer, this site has been built using "free" tools like [GitHub](https://github.com/), Hugo, and Netlify [Paviunt castris](#nemorisque-urimur-violentus)
