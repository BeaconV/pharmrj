## The Ear Examination Evolution

With the announcement of <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PRN00936_ii_Pharmacy-First-Clinical-Pathways-v.1.6.pdf" target="_blank">**7 new national Pharmacy First services**</a> it is time for pharmacists to rapidly upskill and get comfortable with looking in peoplesðŸ‘‚and as with everything else it will be a **practice makes perfect** situation. I have been using <a href="https://amzn.to/3vwVXDQ" target="_blank">**otoscopes**</a> and looking in ears for about 10 years now so some websites, videos and links below that may be helpful.

## How do I do an ear examination?

There is no replacement for good quality Face to Face training from an experienced provider, so please make sure you book on to training that works for you locally. Speak to your LPC, or have a look at <a href="https://cpe.org.uk/national-pharmacy-services/advanced-services/pharmacy-first-service/" target="_blank">**Community Pharmacy England**</a> resouces. They currently point to a suite of <a href="https://www.cppe.ac.uk/services/pharmacy-first/" target="_blank">**Centre for Postgraduate Pharmacy Education**</a> resources including this Video

## Other Videos

I am a big fan of <a href="https://geekymedics.com/" target="_blank"> **Geeky Medics** </a> who have the below fantastic "OSCE Standard" video on ear examination and hearing tests.

Its worth having a look at other videos on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geekymedics" target="_blank"> **YouTube channel**</a> too as they have videos that will be useful for other clinical examination skills too.

Finally there is a very comprehensive video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrJamesGill" target="_blank"> **Dr James Gill**</a>, that goes into the detailed anatomy

## What otoscope should I buy?
NHS England have helpfully provided some guidance on otoscopes in <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PRN00936-i-Community-pharmacy-advanced-service-specification-NHS-pharmacy-first-service-November-2023.pdf" target="_blank"> **Annexe C of the Service Specification** </a> however the cost range of Otoscopes varies hugely from about Â£10 to Â£1000! Below are some thoughts from the few I've tried.

### cheap and cheerful

There are a fair few dozens of Sub Â£20 otoscopes on eBay and Amazon and I carry one of these in My "kit bag" there aren't any bells and whistles and they miss a few of the "recommendations" on the guidance in the spec, but for not much money, they are worth for a practice back up otoscope.
